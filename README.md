# 🛰️ She Orbits: Satellite Ground Tracking Project
**Researcher:** Yeabsira Wubishet Engda  
**Project Type:** Technical Sample & Modular Framework  
**Status:** Final Submission ✅

## 📌 Project Purpose
This repository is a **technical sample** designed for the She Orbits initiative. While it currently tracks the International Space Station (ISS), the code is built as a **modular framework**. 

This means the same logic can be used to track:
* 🛰️ **Weather Satellites** (NOAA)
* 📡 **Communication Constellations** (Starlink)
* 🧪 **Student CubeSats** (Future She Orbits missions)

## ✅ Monthly Deliverables Tracker
