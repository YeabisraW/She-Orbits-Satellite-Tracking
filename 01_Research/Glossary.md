### 1. Two-Line Element Set (TLE)
**Definition:** A data format used to describe the orbital elements of an object at a specific point in time.
**Outreach Tip:** It is a "digital passport" for a satellite.

### 2. Inclination (i)
**Definition:** The angle between the satellite's orbit and the Earth's equator.
**Outreach Tip:** This determines if a satellite can be seen from specific countries.

### 3. Mean Motion
**Definition:** The number of orbits a satellite completes per day.
**Example:** The ISS circles Earth ~15.5 times a day.

### 4. Epoch
**Definition:** The exact timestamp the data was recorded. TLEs must be updated frequently because orbits change!
